h1. README

This is my hacked fork of the original Twitter interpretation of the Programming Scala combinator example.

I wanted this to run under 2.8 and have no dependencies so I've hacked together something that compiles and has the tests passing. This means cutting and pasting code for now but there may be more elegant solutions available later.


h2. From the original README


Scala JSON toolkit originally lifted from Martin Odersky et al's
Programming Scala book. We tightened up some edge cases and added
complete test coverage.

Original code is under the Scala license (LICENSE.scala) and Twitter modifications
are available under the Apache 2 license (LICENSE).
